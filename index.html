            <p>It all started with a picture. A dog up for adoption in Little Rock, AR.</p>

                <p>The dog in question looked like if Golum had a child with the worlds oldest woman. This dog was so terriffyingly cute that I had to have it. To no surprise this dog got adopted immediately. Now I was on the hunt for another rat dog. This had my girlfriend excited. She had wanted me to get a dog for almost a year.</p>

                <h2>On The Hunt</h2>
                <p>Utilizing dog rescue groups we were on the hunt. I live in a one bedroom apartment so I wanted the dog to be less than 20lbs and preferably 4 or more years old, but most importantly, as little hair as possible. I found a example picture and sent it over to my girlfriend.</p>

                <p>In turn she found a rescue dog, named Roscoe in Memphis, TN that seemed to match most of the qualifications. He had sporty little hats to cover his very bald head and probably needs sunscreen while in the sun. I applied for the dog but unfortunately I did not get accepted because they prefer people &gt;60 years old</p>

                <h3>HaeHae?</h3>
                <p>So... we continued on for a few weeks. There were many options but none that were quite perfect. Until one day I received a message with a picture of a dog in Little Rock, AR. This dog appeared to be perfect. Located only three hours away. Appears to be around 12 lbs and very little hair. So we embarked on the road trip with so much excitement. We pull up and the owner comes outside, with very little information about her past other than the fact that her name is "HaeHae", she is maybe 6 years old, had been overbread and is very sweet. She was much smaller than anticipated. She only weighed about 8 lbs and appeared to be pregnant. The owner said the only intact male dog in the house was a pitbull.</p>
                <p>We took her right to Petco to pick up some supplies and booked a vet appointment for the next morning.</p>

                <h4>"Have You Ever Gotten Her Teeth Cleaned?"</h4>
                <p>That was the first question the vet asked. It turns out that she had not had dental care ever and had to get 16 teeth removed. She was also infact pregnant with very little likelihood of surviving the pregnancy so she had to get spayed. She also had worms, was anemic, and last but not least had heartworms</p>
                <p>We left the vet in a little bit of shock. As she cuddled up in my lap, I knew then that she was worth every cent that I was about to spend. the initial visit and the follow up to remove the teeth cost $700. Heartworms are a little bit more complicated. They have to give dogs chemotherapy to get rid of them. </p>

                <h5>On The Road to Getting Better</h5>
                <img src="images/Post-Op.jpg" alt="HaeHae wearing her surgery vest" width="350" height="350">
                <p>For chemotherapy, the dog has to be injected twice over the course of 2 months and then essentially be inactive for the next 6 so that they don't cause any blood clots that would lead to death. We hunkered down and picked up some CBD oil and benadryl to keep her calm. I had heard plenty of horror stories of dogs not being able to control their bowels but thankfully the only bad part was her not having an appetite which the CBD definitely helped with. We even got some rolls in when she was feeling well enough</p>
                <img src="images/haehae-rolling.gif" alt="HaeHae rolling in grass">
    
                <p>About 8 months after we got her, and enough money to buy a used car (also partially due to some stray chicken bones she found), she had a clean bill of health. After further vet visits we are beginning to suspect that she might be closer to 10 years old and we recently found a dog that looks extremely similar to her... we are hoping it is one of her puppies. I will share a few more pictures below so you can really absorb her cuteness. <br>
